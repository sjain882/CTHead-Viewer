## CTHead Viewer

JavaFX image viewer for slices of a CT Scan's data set. Completed as part of a graphics assignment at university.

My first attempt at implementing:
- Nearest neighbour image resizing
- Bilinear interpolation image resizing
- Gamma correction lookup table
- Set of thumbnails all rendered inside an image (no GUI layouts used)
